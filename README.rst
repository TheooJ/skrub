**skrub** (formerly *dirty_cat*) is a Python
library that facilitates prepping your tables for machine learning.

What can skrub do?
--------------------

The goal of skrub is to facilitate building and deploying machine-learning
models on tabular data.

skrub provides high-level tools for joining dataframes (``Joiner``, ``AggJoiner``, ...),
encoding columns (``MinHashEncoder``, ``ToCategorical``, ...), building a pipeline
(``TableVectorizer``, ``tabular_learner``, ...), and more.

    >>> from skrub.datasets import fetch_employee_salaries
    >>> dataset = fetch_employee_salaries()
    >>> df = dataset.X
    >>> y = dataset.y
    # from a complex dataframe
    >>> df

See our `examples <https://skrub-data.org/stable/auto_examples>`_.

What skrub cannot do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Semantic similarities <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity>`_
are currently not supported.
For example, the similarity between *car* and *automobile* is outside the reach
of the methods implemented here.

This kind of problem is tackled by
`Natural Language Processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_
methods.

skrub can still help with handling typos and variations in this kind of setting.

Installation
------------

skrub can be easily installed via `pip` or conda. For more installation information, see
the `installation instructions <https://skrub-data.org/stable/install.html>`_.

Contributing
------------

The best way to support the development of skrub is to spread the word!
