**skrub** (formerly *dirty_cat*) is a Python
library that facilitates prepping your tables for machine learning.

If you like the package, spread the word and ‚≠ê this repository!

What can skrub do?
--------------------

skrub provides data assembling tools (``TableVectorizer``, ``fuzzy_join``...) and
encoders (``GapEncoder``, ``MinHashEncoder``...) for **morphological similarities**,
for which we usually identify three common cases: **similarities, typos and variations**

See our `examples <https://skrub-data.org/stable/auto_examples>`_.

What skrub cannot do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Semantic similarities <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity>`_
are currently not supported.
For example, the similarity between *car* and *automobile* is outside the reach
of the methods implemented here.

This kind of problem is tackled by
`Natural Language Processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_
methods.

skrub can still help with handling typos and variations in this kind of setting.

Installation
------------

skrub can be easily installed via `pip` or conda. For more installation information, see
the `installation instructions <https://skrub-data.org/stable/install.html>`_.

Contributing
------------

The best way to support the development of skrub is to spread the word!

Also, if you already are a skrub user, we would love to hear about your use cases and challenges in the `Discussions <https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/discussions>`_ section.
