The purpose of this guide is to provide an introduction to the functionalities of ``skrub``, an
open-source package that aims at bridging the gap between tabular data sources and machine-learning models.
Please refer to the `installation guidelines <https://skrub-data.org/stable/install.html>`_ to install ``skrub``.

Vectorizing data
----------------

Much of ``skrub`` revolves around cleaning, assembling, and encoding tabular data, to provide a format that
machine learning models understand.

``Skrub`` allows imperfect assembly of data

+ Example with ``Joiner``

Backend interoperability
